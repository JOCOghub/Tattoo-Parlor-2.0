This application has full user profile capabilities such as creating a profile, booking an appointment associated with a specific tattoo artist, and the user can edit or delete that appointment. There is also an index page for a user to view all of their appointments. If a use wants to search or a specific appoibntment of theirs there is a search bar that allows them to do so.
